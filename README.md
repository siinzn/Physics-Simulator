# Physics Simulator

In this project, I wanted to experiment how 2D vector works and test out some real world physics using C++. 
Using Tiny Graphics Library as main screen for the project, i was able to achieve the following:

**Major Steps:**

1 - Make Particle with tigrCircle really easily.

2 - Add acceleration downwards to the particle to simulate gravity along with boundary checks

3 - Add Mouse repulsion using tigrCircle and some maths

4 - Add particle - particle repulsion using physics of change in momentum and energy loss due to elasticity and Newtons third law.

5 - Added colors for the particle with TPixel tigrRGB really easily.

**Future Improvments & Bugs:**

1 - Fix laggy animations when the radius of the particle is too small.

2 - Use OpenGL or SFML for advancded graphics to be able to handle higher number of particles.

3 - Add effects or trails for the particles

**This project was heavily inspired by Keyframe Codes on youtube**
